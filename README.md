# Sending Post Data with React

Besides from reading from another data source, we can also use Axios to send data. You already know the most you need to know. You know how to control forms with React and you know how to use Axios. What's left is sending data from your form with Axios! This lesson is using <a href="https://ih-beers-api.herokuapp.com/">this api</a>.

## CORS
There are a couple of pitfalls when sending data with React, especially in development. Most of them are because of Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors. CORS is a security feature that tries to prevent an attack called<a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A7-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS)"> cross site scripting</a>. To prevent XSS browserss and servers don't trust different domains (origins) by default. In a SPA architecture it's common to host the client and server on different domains. If that's the case with your app, your React client and your Express backend do not trust each other. However, you could decide to host your client and backend from the same domain, meaning the same url, port and transport layer (http or https). 

In development you're probably using the development server that create react app set you up with. That development server is running on a different port than your backend. Therefore, in development you're probably hosting your app on different domains. 

Another thing to keep in mind is that sending data tightens the security settings of CORS even stronger. Whether you're sending data or not and in which format (x-www-form-url-encoded or json) influences CORS errors. 

Alright, so how to deal with CORS?

## Method 1: Do not trigger CORS
If you send it in the "x-www-form-urlencoded" format, the CORS settings are less tight and you can send it normally. However, you need to parse the data you have in your state into the x-www-form-urlencoded format. You do that with the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/qs"> qs library </a>. In the qs docs you'll find examples with require, but it works just as fine with import:

```
    import qs from "qs";
    ...

    ...
    handleAddBeerSubmit(){
        axios({
            method: "POST",
            url: "https://ih-beers-api.herokuapp.com/beers/new",
            data: qs.stringify(this.state.beer),
            headers: {
                "content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
            }
        })
        .then((response)=> {
            // you could redirect to the detail page of the beer you just created
            // assuming you're using react router:
            this.props.history.push(`/beer/detail/${response.data.id}`)
        })
        .catch((error)=> {
            console.log(error.response.data)
            // you could update the state to show the error to the user
        })
    }
    ...

```

## Method 2: Allow CORS
If you want to send data from the client to the backend, you have to consider the data format. If you really want to send it in JSON you have to pass the withCredentials option to axios: 

```
    ...
    handleAddBeerSubmit(){
        axios({
            method: "POST",
            url: "https://ih-beers-api.herokuapp.com/beers/new",
            data: this.state.beer, //different
            withCredentials: true,
            headers: {
                "content-type": "application/json" //different
            }
        }
        .then((response)=> {
            // you could redirect to the detail page of the beer you just created
            // assuming you're using react router:
            this.props.history.push(`/beer/detail/${response.data.id}`)
        })
        .catch((error)=> {
            console.log(error.response.data)
            // you could update the state to show the error to the user
        })
    }
    ...
```

When you're creating your own backend for the final project, you still need to enable cors in express. You can use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors" />cors library </a> for that.

## Method 3 Circumvent CORS all together
You can also let the development server use a proxy. That way, your browser thinks everything is hosted on the same domain and CORS will not even be an issue. You have to put the following in your package.json file: 
```
{
    ...
    "proxy": "http://localhost:portYouAreRunningYourBackendOn",
    ...
}
```
This works the best if all your axios requests are reading the baseUrl from your .env file. For further reference look up the cra docs about <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development">proxying</a> and <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables"> environment variables</a>. To finish it all off, <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/using-https-in-development/">run your dev-server over https</a>: `HTTPS=true npm start`. <small>(for bash)</small>.

So why is this all the way at the bottom? Well, nowadays most of the applications are often deployed as small units called services. The term for that is <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html"> microservice architecture </a>. So normally your back-end would run on another domain than your front-end, your database or your file server (like Cloudinary). Besides, you're going to stumble upon CORS errors sooner or later anyways. ;) It's usefull to know how they are caused and how to deal with them.
